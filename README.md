# Ayesha OSINT Toolkit

This is my first OSINT toolkit project. It includes several tools for performing various OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tasks such as username checking, email validation, and IP lookup. These scripts help gather information from publicly available data sources.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requests library (for API calls)

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the necessary libraries required to run the scripts.

Usage
Username Checker:
Use this script to check if a username is available on various platforms.

Example usage:

bash

python scripts/username_checker.py
Email Finder:
This script helps to find email addresses associated with a specific domain.

Example usage:

bash

Edit
python scripts/email_finder.py
IP Lookup:
This script provides detailed information about an IP address, such as location, ISP, and more.

Example usage:

Each of the scripts is designed to perform a specific OSINT task, and you can run them individually based on your needs.
